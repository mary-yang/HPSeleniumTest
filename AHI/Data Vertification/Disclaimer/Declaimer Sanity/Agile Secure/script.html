	<td>General DisclaimersHealth Benefit plans are not health insurance, are not designed to replace the minimal essential coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and do not cover pre-existing conditions. Each state has specific mandates for coverage so your plan may include additional benefits. Please consult your state-specific insurance certificate for more information. Limited Benefit Health Insurance product prices, benefits, and availability may vary by state. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TAX. Short Term health insurance is health insurance outside of the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"). It does not include all ten of the minimum essential benefits of Obamacare and it does not cover pre-existing conditions. To learn more about the tax, its exemptions, and how to calculate the affordability of short term health with the tax, see here. To learn more about the differences between Short Term health insurance and Obamacare, see here.

	<td>Agile HealthInsurance Terms and AgreementsWelcome Thank you for visiting AgileHealthInsurance.com. Our goal is to be your trusted partner in major medical insurance outside of Obamacare. We provide online tools so that you can find your best plan, make smart health insurance decisions, and save money. Your Agreement By using our website, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use. You will not use our website for any purpose that is unlawful, illegal or in violation of these Terms of Use. You also agree to our Privacy Policy, which covers how we handle your personal information. From time to time, we may update these Terms of Use. When we do, we will post the date on this page. By continuing to use our site, you are agreeing to the updated Terms of Use. Who We Are AgileHealthInsurance.com is a Silicon Valley based technology company; our team has decades of experience delivering health insurance solutions to consumers . We are also a licensed agency and you can find out more about our state-specific insurance licenses here. In 2014, we were acquired by Health Insurance Innovations, Inc (“HII”). and we operate as an independently managed division of another HII entity, Health Plan Intermediaries, LLC (collectively, “HII”). For the purposes of these Terms of Use, “Agile,” Agile Health Insurance,” “AgileHealthInsurance.com,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to HII and, if applicable, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates. The terms “either of us,” “we each,” or “we both” shall refer to us, on the one hand, and you, on the other. What We Do We provide the tools so that you can search, compare, find and apply for health insurance products. Think of us as an engine of information. If you find a plan on our site and decide to submit an application, we will transfer you and your application to the entity processing your application, which may be HII or the carrier. Be sure to read the privacy and terms of use policy for the entity processing your application. We are not an insurance carrier, so we don’t underwrite your insurance and we don’t process or manage insurance claims. The insurance carrier handles those services. We Know Major Medical Insurance We believe that health insurance is not a one size fits all market. Life is full of unexpected changes and transitions. You may need insurance to cover a short-term gap, help you through a period of unemployment, or have found that Obamacare is unavailable, out of reach, or not the right solution for you. Term health insurance serves as a flexible and affordable option. It is major medical insurance that will protect you in case of accident or illness and you can apply for it at any time. That’s why we are proud to offer term health insurance. Term health insurance is not Obamacare, so you may be subject to the Affordable Care Act Uninsured Tax. You can learn more here. Our Ancillary Products Through our partnership with Companion Life and the Med-Sense Guaranteed Association, we offer Agile One and Agile Secure—supplemental insurance and health products that provide additional financial protection from accidents, critical illnesses, sickness, and much more. Agile One and Agile Secure are membership levels in the Med-Sense Guaranteed Association that allows these products to be sold together. They are not Obamacare plans and are not designed to replace your major medical insurance. On our site, you can also explore options for dental and vision insurance with our partners. When considering health insurance, know your health and what you need. If you’re concerned that your major medical does not provide adequate coverage for critical illness, or if you need dental care, then our ancillary products can fill in those gaps. Existing Insurance Coverage If you’ve found a health insurance plan through us, we are thrilled that we were able to help. However, be Insurance Wise.
