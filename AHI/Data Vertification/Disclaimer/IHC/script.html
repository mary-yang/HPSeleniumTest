	<td>Important Information About This Quote and Our Plans PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INSURANCE PLAN. PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE, PREMIUM AMOUNT, BENEFITS, LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND ANY BENEFIT RIDER, IF APPLICABLE. The quote includes premium, monthly fees and a one-time initial enrollment fee. Refunds are not available after your 10-day right to return period as outlined in the first page of your policy unless required by state law. All applications and insurance quotes are subject to final approval by our Policy Administration Department prior to issuance. All quotes shown are estimates ONLY. Premium will not change unless effective date changes or the applicant provides updated information prior to certificate issuance. If the insured selects an optional benefit, that is included in the quote. The quote shown above is for your requested effective date ONLY. If the actual effective date of your policy is different from the requested effective date, the actual cost of your policy may differ from the quote above. If such a cost variance occurs you will be notified of your actual cost of coverage by our Policy Administration Department prior to issuance. The application and initial payment must be received by us prior to the requested effective date. If a monthly billing method has been selected, future payments will be due monthly on the billing date. ENROLLMENT AND MONTHLY FEE DISCLOSURE: A one-time enrollment fee is applied to your initial payment. A separate monthly fee is included in the monthly charge. The enrollment and/or monthly fee will not affect your eligibility for coverage. Replacement of any existing policy: This is not an ACA-qualified plan. If you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing health insurance and replace it with a policy to be issued by Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York, please note that the coverage is not Minimum Essential Coverage as defined by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). You may still be subject to the federal tax assessed against individuals without Minimum Essential Coverage. We recommend that you read and understand the terms of the Policy carefully including effective date, premium amount, total monthly cost, benefits, limitations, and exclusions. Short Term Medical (STM) is a limited duration medical expense policy and is non-renewable. STM is not a replacement for the comprehensive health insurance required under the ACA. This coverage has a pre-existing condition limitation provision. These plans are not available in all states and availability in a state is subject to change. If you submit an application for a state where the plan is no longer available, your application and premium (if included) will be returned and coverage will not be effective. Pre-Existing Condition Limitation _ The short-term limited duration medical expense product does not provide portability of prior coverage. Any injury, sickness for which you have incurred charges, received medical treatment, consulted a health care professional, or taken prescription drugs within 5 years (length depends on state) of the effective date of coverage will not be covered. Non-Renewable - If you purchase a new policy, any conditions for which you incurred claims under the prior policy is considered a pre-existing condition. The purchase of a new policy is not guaranteed and you may be ineligible for new coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The new policy will have a new deductible and coinsurance limit to be satisfied according to the policy documents.
