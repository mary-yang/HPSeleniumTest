	<td>*National General FRAUD WARNING Any person who, with intent to defraud or knowing that he is facilitating a fraud against an insurer, submits an application or files a claim containing a false or deceptive statement may be guilty of insurance fraud as determined by a court of law. NATIONAL GENERAL SHORT TERM MEDICAL AUTHORIZATIONS 1. I agree that coverage will not become effective for any person whose medical history changes prior to coverage approval, such that the person's answer would be 'yes' to any of the Medical History questions in this application. If such person is the Applicant, coverage is automatically declined for all persons included in this application. 2. I understand that health insurance benefits are excluded for pre-existing conditions. 3. I understand that the broker who solicited this application was acting as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the Insurance Company. I further acknowledge that the person who solicited this application and upon whose explanation of benefits, limitations or exclusions we relied, was retained by me as my agent, and that such person has no right to bind or approve coverage or alter any of the terms or conditions of the policy. 4. I understand that any material misstatement or omission of information made on this form will be considered a misrepresentation and may be the basis for later rescission of my coverage and that of my dependents. In the event of rescission, the Insurer will refund premiums received for any coverage rescinded; however, the Insurer will subtract total claim payments for the persons rescinded from this premium refund. If the Insurer has paid claims in excess of the amount of premium received, the Insurer has the right to obtain a refund from You. 5. I have read this application and have verified that all of the information provided in it is complete, true and correct, and is all within my personal knowledge. I agree to immediately notify the insurer of any changes in any of the information contained in this form which may occur prior to the approval of coverage. I understand that this type of plan is NOT considered "minimum essential coverage" under the Affordable Care Act and therefore I may be subject to a tax penalty. This is not designated as a substitute for comprehensive major medical coverage. I understand that this plan does not cover any Pre-Existing Conditions. A Pre-Existing Condition means a condition for which medical advice or treatment (includes receiving services and supplies, consultations, diagnostic tests or prescription medicines) was received by the Covered Person during the 12 months prior to the Effective Date; or that had manifested itself in such a manner that would have caused an ordinarily prudent person to seek medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment within the 12 months immediately preceding the Effective Date. I further understand that there are other restrictions and exclusions I understand I will gain access to my plan materials via the Policy Document Center, a link to the Center will be sent electronically to the email address I provided on my application. I understand it is my responsibility to review all the information to fully understand the benefits and to be sure they are consistent with my understanding of the plans I have purchased. If there is any difference between my understanding of how the policy works, what was presented to me at the time of enrollment, and what is written in the policy certificate, the terms of the policy certificate will govern. I understand that I will have 10 days from the effective date to review the policy materials I can cancel for a full refund, provided I furnish written notification to Member Services within the first 10-day period. Policies cancelled within the 10-day period will be terminated back to the effective date and I will forfeit any potential claims as a result of the cancellation. For cancellations after the first 10-day period, a written cancellation request must be received at least 10 days prior to the policy's anniversary date to take effect for that coverage period. I understand there are no prorated fees or rebates after the first 10 days of coverage. I authorize and request the Company to initiate electronic payments against the indicated bank account or credit card for the payment of premiums and other indicated monthly dues included in the plan(s) being purchased, and to continue to initiate such payments until cancelled by me in writing. I agree that my electronic payment authorization may be terminated by providing written notice to the Company. I agree to submit this application by electronic means. By signing this application electronically, I certify that my answers are correct and complete to the best of my knowledge, including information provided for each applicant applying for benefits. I understand that an electronic signature has the same legal effect and can be enforced in the same way as a written signature. PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION The accountholder of the bank account or credit card provided during this enrollment process authorizes and requests the Company to initiate automatic electronic payments against such indicated bank account or credit card for the payment of premiums and other indicated monthly dues included in the plan(s) being purchased during this enrollment process. Accountholder agrees that the electronic payment authorization for such automatic payments may be terminated by providing written notice to the Company.*</td>
