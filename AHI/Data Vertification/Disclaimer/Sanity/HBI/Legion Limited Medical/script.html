This proxy shall be valid until revoked at any time prior to voting at any meeting by executing and delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Association, by executing and delivering a subsequently dated proxy to the Secretary of the Association or by voting in person. Nothing herein shall create any employer-employee relationship between the Association and any Member.
