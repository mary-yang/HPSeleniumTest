	<td>I hereby request coverage under the insurance issued to the Med-Sense Guaranteed Association and underwritten by Companion Life Insurance Company. I understand this insurance contains a Pre-existing Condition exclusion, a Pre-certification Penalty and other restrictions and exclusions. I agree that coverage will not become effective for me or any dependent whose medical status, prior to the effective date, has changed and therefore results in a “yes” answer to any of the medical questions on this Application. If my medical status changes in this way, coverage will be declined for all individuals included on this application. I understand that if I have elected the Monthly Payment option, my credit card will be charged each month on the due date of the premium for 6 or 12 months, depending on the plan I have selected. I understand that I may terminate the scheduled payments by notifying Health Insurance Innovations in writing at least one business day prior to the next scheduled payment date. I understand that this coverage is not renewable or extendable. I understand that the information contained herein is a summary of the coverage offered in the Certificate of Insurance and that I may obtain a complete copy of the Certificate of Insurance upon request to Health Insurance Innovations. I understand that Companion Life, as underwriter of the plan, is solely liable for the coverage and benefits provided under the insurance. I understand and agree that the insurance agent/broker, if any, assisting with this Application is a representative of the Applicant. If signed by a representative of the Applicant, the undersigned represents his/her capacity to so act. If signed as guardian or proxy of the Applicant, the undersigned represents his/her capacity to so act. By acceptance of coverage and/or submission of any claim for benefits, the Applicant ratifies the authority of the signer to so act and bind the Applicant. If I am not already a member of the Med-Sense Guaranteed Association, I hereby request to be enrolled as a member. I will receive access to a membership packet after my membership fees are received.</td>
