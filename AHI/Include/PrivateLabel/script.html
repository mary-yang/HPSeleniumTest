<td>${PL_CN} TERMS AND AGREEMENTS GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I accept and acknowledge that in several states, these plans are not individual health insurance and are available only to members of an association, an independent consumer organization. If I am not already a member of the association, I must join in order to be eligible for these plans. The association and its fees have been presented to me during my purchasing process. In the event that I am already a member of the organization, I accept and acknowledge that I am not purchasing an additional membership, but may be charged the membership's administrative fee for add-on products. I accept and acknowledge that I must understand and agree with the terms of the insurance policy, paying attention to the effective date, premium amount, waiting period, benefits, limitations, exclusions, and riders, if applicable in my state. I accept and acknowledge that the quotes or rates shown above are estimates only. My applicable Fees (Membership Fees or premium as applicable) is subject to change based on the optional benefits I selected, if any, and other relevant factors, such as changes in rates that take effect before my coverage start date. The insurance company always determines my actual Fees. Insurance companies reserve the right to change the terms of a policy upon proper notification. These rates may include monthly administration fees or Membership dues. I accept and acknowledge that the quotes or rates shown above are for my requested effective date ONLY. If the actual effective date of my policy is different from the requested effective date, the actual Fees of my policy may differ from the quote or rate above. The change in amount may be due to Fee increases or policy changes from the insurance company and/or one or more family members having a birthday. (Rates are highly dependent on age.) The carrier I selected may not guarantee their rates for any period of time. I accept and acknowledge that coverage effective date is dependent upon approval of my application, which may include qualifying for the coverage and receipt of payment, and may be different than my requested date. The coverage effective date once the application is approved by the carrier may be pushed forward due to each carrier's deadlines and processing times. I accept and acknowledge that carriers cannot guarantee the availability of a provider (or providers), and may add, delete or change a participating provider (or providers) at any time without prior notice to me. I must contact my chosen carrier for updated information before using the services of any provider. Insurance benefits underwritten by Federal Insurance Company are not dependent upon the use of any provider network. I accept and acknowledge that any Copayment, Deductible, and Coinsurance amounts are my share of the costs for covered benefits. I accept and acknowledge that each insurance carrier and product provider may have unique Notices and Disclaimers. I will check for information regarding the plans, products and carriers I selected. I further accept and acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and understand each plan and product policy selected. I accept and acknowledge that if I am not completely satisfied, in most states, I can cancel this coverage within the 10-Day Free Look provision, shown in the Certificate of Insurance, for a refund of premiums. If this Enrollment Form is completed electronically, I agree that my electronic signature serves as my original signature. If purchasing major medical insurance such as Short Term Health Insurance or dental insurance, I accept and acknowledge that I must not cancel any health insurance coverage that I currently have or decline cobra benefits until I receive an approval letter and insurance policy (also known as an insurance contract or certificate) from the insurance company that I have selected. I have personally completed and reviewed all of my answers to the questions in this enrollment form and represent that all information I have provided is true, complete, and correctly recorded. I understand that this information will be used to determine each person's eligibility and insurability for coverage under the Policy and any false statement or misrepresentation may result in loss of coverage or claim denial. The Applicant (and Spouse or Dependent if coverage elected) must be accepted based on the Company's rules in effect on the date of enrollment and on the Certificate Effective Date. Coverage (or Reinstatement of coverage), if issued and approved by the Company, will become effective on the date recorded in the Certificate Schedule of Benefits and not the date this enrollment form is signed. I understand that no agent or producer can accept risks, modify policies, or waive any rights or requirements of the Company. I accept and acknowledge that the products presented on this website are not those of ${PL_CN} and are owned and administered by the respective companies identified in the applicable product brochure. SHORT TERM HEALTH INSURANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT If purchasing Short-Term Health Insurance, I accept and acknowledge that Short-Term health insurance is a temporary plan designed for people who do not currently have health insurance and are waiting for longer term, major medical insurance coverage. Short-term policies do not cover pre-existing conditions. The health insurance plans sold through this Website do not meet the minimum essential coverage under the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act and I may incur a penalty and be assessed a fee with my federal tax return if I only purchase such plans. HEALTH BENEFIT INDEMNITY INSURANCE ACKNOWLEDGMENT If purchasing Health Benefit Indemnity insurance, I accept and acknowledge that HBI is not major medical insurance. HBI is designed to make cash payments to the insured in the event of a covered incident. It does not cover pre-existing conditions, and does not meet the minimum essential coverage under the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act and I may incur a penalty and be assessed a fee with my federal tax return if I only purchase such plans. ADDITIONAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL AND LIFESTYLE BENEFIT PRODUCTS I accept and acknowledge that supplemental insurance products such as Agile Secure, critical illness, and accident medical insurance are not major medical insurance. Without an Affordable Care Act compliant plan (such as Obamacare or an employer-based plan), I may incur a penalty and be assessed a fee with my federal tax return if I do not have such a plan. Supplemental insurance products do not provide coverage for pre-existing conditions. I accept and acknowledge that services including Teladoc, Karis360, RX Helpline AgileRX, and other supplemental products and services are not insurance benefits and do not replace health insurance. These are lifestyle services and benefits and are not affiliated with any of the insurance companies. The range of the discounts will vary depending on the type of provider and services rendered. These programs do not make payments directly to providers. Members are required to pay for all health care services. Teladoc does not replace the primary care physician. Teladoc does not guarantee that a prescription will be written. Teladoc operates subject to state regulation and may not be available in certain states. Teladoc does not prescribe DEA-controlled substances, non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse. Teladoc physicians reserve the right to deny care for potential misuse of services.
