	<td>What is Health Benefit Indemnity Insurance?Health Benefit Indemnity insurance (HBI) is a health insurance plan that offers financial protection for commonly needed medical services, including hospital and doctor benefits. When you experience a covered medical event, HBI pays a set fee, directly to you or a provider designated by you. HBI also can include supplemental medical insurance coverage for critical illnesses or accidents, as well as non insurance supplemental health benefits such as telemedicine, insurance advocacy, and pharmacy. It is designed to work with a major medical type insurance plan. Unlike traditional insurance, where you are responsible for paying co-pays and coinsurance , HBI provides you "first dollar" coverage, without co-pays or coinsurance. This first dollar coverage provides you flexibility for managing health care expenses. HBI is typically paid for on a monthly basis and all plans offered on AgileHealthInsurance can be purchased by a simple online application without medical underwriting.
