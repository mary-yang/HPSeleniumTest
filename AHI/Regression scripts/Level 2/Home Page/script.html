	<td>What is Health Benefit Insurance?Health Benefit Insurance is a health insurance plan that offers financial protection for commonly needed medical services, including hospital and doctor benefits. When you experience a covered medical event, health benefit insurance pays a set fee, directly to you or a provider designated by you. Health Benefit Insurance also can include supplemental medical insurance coverage for critical illnesses or accidents, as well as non insurance supplemental health benefits such as telemedicine, insurance advocacy, and pharmacy. Unlike traditional insurance, where you are responsible for paying co-pays and coinsurance , Health Benefit Insurance provides you “first dollar” coverage, without co-pays or coinsurance. This first dollar coverage provides you more flexibility for managing health care expenses. Health Benefit Insurance is typically paid for on a monthly basis and all plans offered on AgileHealthInsurance can be purchased by a simple online application without medical underwriting.

	<td>What are Supplemental Health Products?Supplemental health products are products designed to be purchased in addition to a major medical health plan (such as a short term or an ACA/Obamacare health plan) or a health benefit insurance plan. There are two basic types: supplemental health insurance or non insurance supplemental health products. The most common supplemental health insurance products are dental insurance, vision insurance, and supplemental medical insurance. Supplemental medical insurance includes critical illness and accident insurances that will pay a set amount when you experience a covered medical event. The most common non insurance supplemental health products are telemedicine, which facilitates 24/7 access to medical providers, insurance advocacy services, which help you to better utilize your health plan, and pharmacy benefits, which provides you discounts for prescription and over the counter medications.</td>

	<td>Short Term Health Insurance is health insurance outside of the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"). Health Benefit Insurance is comprised of fixed indemnity and may include supplemental insurance products and non insurance supplementary health products/services; it is not major medical insurance. Neither Short Term Health Insurance nor Health Benefit Insurance cover pre-existing conditions, they do not include all ten of the minimum essential benefits of Obamacare, and you may be subject to the Affordable Care Act Uninsured Tax (The 2017 Congressional Tax Reform Act does not eliminate this tax until 2019).
