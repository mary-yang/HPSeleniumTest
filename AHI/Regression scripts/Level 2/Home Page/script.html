	<td>What is Health Benefit Indemnity Insurance?Health Benefit Indemnity insurance (HBI) is a health insurance plan that offers financial protection for commonly needed medical services, including hospital and doctor benefits. When you experience a covered medical event, HBI pays a set fee, directly to you or a provider designated by you. HBI also can include supplemental medical insurance coverage for critical illnesses or accidents, as well as non insurance supplemental health benefits such as telemedicine, insurance advocacy, and pharmacy. Unlike traditional insurance, where you are responsible for paying co-pays and coinsurance , HBI provides you "first dollar" coverage, without co-pays or coinsurance. This first dollar coverage provides you more flexibility for managing health care expenses. HBI is typically paid for on a monthly basis and all plans offered on AgileHealthInsurance can be purchased by a simple online application without medical underwriting.

	<td>*What are Supplemental Health Products?Supplemental health products are products designed to be purchased in addition to a major medical health plan (such as a short term or an ACA/Obamacare health plan) or a Health Benefit Indemnity insurance plan. There are two basic types: supplemental health insurance or non insurance supplemental health products. The most common supplemental health insurance products are dental insurance, vision insurance, and supplemental medical insurance. Supplemental medical insurance includes critical illness and accident insurances that will pay a set amount when you experience a covered medical event. The most common non insurance supplemental health products are telemedicine, which facilitates 24/7 access to medical providers, insurance advocacy services, which help you to better utilize your health plan, and pharmacy benefits, which provides you discounts for prescription and over the counter medications.*</td>
