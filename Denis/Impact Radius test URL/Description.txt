test Impact Radius test URL for philip.


Phillip passed this info for testing:

 Here is the Impact Radius testing link that should be used for TestProd testing: www.agilehealthinsurance.7eer.net/c/163375/292491/3530.

This is a test link he sets up that will be redirected to our testprod.  But it is not the production links we are using for post release testing.   You can use it for more extensive testing on test prod.

Thanks,

Jiang
