	<td>AGILELIFEINSURANCE TERMS AND AGREEMENTS
GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
 
 
I accept and acknowledge that I must understand and agree with the terms of the life insurance policy, paying attention to the effective date, premium amount, waiting period, benefits, limitations, exclusions, and riders, if applicable in my state.
I accept and acknowledge that the quotes or rates shown above are estimates only. My applicable Fees is subject to change based on the optional benefits I selected, if any, and other relevant factors, such as changes in rates that take effect before my coverage start date. The insurance company always determines my actual Fees. Insurance companies reserve the right to change the terms of a policy upon proper notification. These rates may include monthly administration fees or membership dues.
I accept and acknowledge that the quotes or rates shown on this website are for my requested effective date ONLY. If the actual effective date of my policy is different from the requested effective date, the actual Fees of my policy may differ from the quote or rate above. The change in amount may be due to Fee increases or policy changes from the insurance company and/or one or more family members having a birthday. (Rates are highly dependent on age.) The carrier I selected may not guarantee their rates for any period of time.
I accept and acknowledge that coverage effective date is dependent upon approval of my application, which may include qualifying for the coverage and receipt of payment, and may be different than my requested date. The coverage effective date once the application is approved by the carrier may be pushed forward due to each carrier’s deadlines and processing times.
I accept and acknowledge that each insurance carrier may have unique Notices and Disclaimers. I will check for information regarding the plans, products and carriers I selected. I further accept and acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and understand each plan and product policy selected. 
I accept and acknowledge that if I am not completely satisfied, in most states, I can cancel this coverage within the Free Look provision, shown in the Certificate of Insurance, for a refund of premiums.
If this Enrollment Form is completed electronically, I agree that my electronic signature serves as my original signature. 
I have personally completed and reviewed all of my answers to the questions in this enrollment form and represent that all information I have provided is true, complete, and correctly recorded. I understand that this information will be used to determine each person’s eligibility and insurability for coverage under the Policy and any false statement or misrepresentation may result in loss of coverage or claim denial. The Applicant (and Spouse or Dependent if coverage elected) must be accepted based on the Company’s rules in effect on the date of enrollment and on the Certificate Effective Date. Coverage (or Reinstatement of coverage), if issued and approved by the Company, will become effective on the date recorded in the Certificate Schedule of Benefits and not the date this enrollment form is signed. I understand that no agent or producer can accept risks, modify policies, or waive any rights or requirements of the Company.
I accept and acknowledge that the products presented on this website are not those of Agilelifeinsurance.com (or it’s agency, HealthPocket Agency d/b/a AgileHealthInsurance) and are owned and administered by the respective companies identified in the applicable product brochure.

	<td>PAYMENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I am signing up for an automatic payment plan. I agree that AgileLifeInsurance or its authorized agent may automatically debit my bank account or credit card for the amount due on or around the payment due date. I understand that this authorization will remain in effect until I cancel it in writing, and I agree to notify AgileHealthInsurance or its authorized agent in writing of any changes in my account information or termination of this authorization, which must be received by AgileHealthInsurance or its agent at least 7 days prior to the next billing date. If the above-noted periodic payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, I understand that the payment may be executed on the next business day. I understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account as soon as the above-noted periodic transaction dates. The charge will appear on my statement as Health Insurance Innov. I agree that AgileHealthInsurance or my financial institution can cancel automatic payment for my account for any reason, at any time, with or without prior notice to me. In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected for Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF), I understand that AgileLifeInsurance or its agent may, at its discretion, attempt to process the charge again within 30 days, and I agree to an additional $25.00 charge for each attempt, which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the authorized recurring payment. I acknowledge that the origination of these debits to my account must comply with U.S. laws. This payment authorization is for the type of bill indicated above. I certify that I am an authorized user of this credit card or bank account. I agree not to dispute this recurring billing with my bank or card issuer so long as the transactions correspond to the terms indicated in this authorization form. I have a copy of this agreement and I know I can also contact AgileLifeInsurance at support@agilelifeinsurance.com or 800-314-5594 for a copy.</td>
