	<td>*CARDINAL CHOICE TERMS AND AGREEMENTS CARDINAL CHOICE FRAUD WARNING NOTICE Any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud any insurance company or other person, files an application for insurance containing any false information, or conceals for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any material fact thereto, commits a fraudulent insurance act, which is a crime. Penalties include imprisonment and/or fines. In addition, an insurer may deny insurance benefits if false information materially related to a claim was provided by the Applicant or Insured Person. CARDINAL CHOICE INSURANCE ACCEPTANCE The undersigned represents to the best of his or her knowledge and belief that all information provided in this application and any attachments hereto is true and correct. The undersigned understands that all information provided in this application and any attachments hereto is material to the Company's decision to provide this insurance, and that insurance will be provided in reliance upon the truth of such information. It is hereby agreed and understood this insurance is provided by the Company in consideration of payment of the required premium. The insurance begins on the later of: 1) on the date the policy is effective; or 2) when We accept the eligible person's application. I also understand that Federal Insurance Company will not pay benefits for any medical condition or illness due to a Pre-existing Condition. Preexisting Condition means an Accident or a Sickness for which, in the 12 months before the Covered Person becomes insured under the policy, medical advice, treatment or care was sought by a Covered Person, or was recommended by, prescribed by or received from a Physician. A condition shall no longer be considered a Pre-Existing Condition after the date a person has been covered under the Policy for 12 consecutive months. The POLICY provides limited benefits. Review your POLICY carefully. THIS IS A SUPPLEMENT TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR MAJOR MEDICAL COVERAGE. LACK OF MAJOR MEDICAL COVERAGE (OR OTHER MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE) MAY RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT WITH YOUR TAXES. CARDINAL CHOICE MEMBERSHIP ENROLLMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (Not applicable for residents of LA, MO, NC, NV, UT, WV) I hereby enroll for membership in the Med Sense Guaranteed Association (MSGA). As a member of MSGA, understand that I will be able to access membership products, benefits and services. I acknowledge that member benefits are subject to change without notice. Non U.S. residents are eligible for coverage if they have had a primary residence in the U.S. for 12 consecutive months prior to the effective date of coverage.*</td>
