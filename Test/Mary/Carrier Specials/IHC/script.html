If the above noted periodic payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, I understand that the payment may be executed on the next business day. I understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account as soon as the above noted periodic transaction dates. In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected for Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) I understand that the Ebix Health Administration Exchange, Inc. or its designated administrator may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again within 30 days, and agree to an additional $25.00 charge for each attempt returned NSF which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the authorized recurring payment. I acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to my account must comply with the provisions of U.S. law. I agree not to dispute this recurring billing with my bank so long as the transactions correspond to the terms indicated in this authorization form.</td>
