	<td>Golden Rule Specific Disclaimers Golden Rule Insurance Company, a UnitedHealthcare Company, is the underwriter of these plans.Short Term Plans require a one-time application fee of $20.00.These Short Term medical plans do not provide coverage for preexisting conditions nor the mandated coverage necessary to avoid a penalty under the Affordable Care Act.Expenses for injuries are eligible for coverage as of the effective date of coverage; expenses for illnesses are eligible for coverage beginning on the 6th day following the effective date of coverage. This screen is intended only as general information. It presents only a brief overview of some of the standard benefits of the plan(s) shown. Optional benefits may be available for additional premium.Before you apply, please use the link(s) provided to download and review the product information for a more complete explanation of benefits, exclusions (including any that may apply to preexisting conditions), limitations, terms under which the plan(s) may not be renewed or benefits may be reduced, and any state variations applicable to any of these items. You must meet our eligibility requirements in order to become insured, which may include medical underwriting. There is no coverage until we inform you in writing that your application has been processed and approved.To be considered for reimbursement, expenses must qualify as "covered expenses" under the policy, and are also subject to all other policy provisions, such as reasonable and customary or eligible expense limits, or whether or not they were necessary.Estimated Premium shown is based on the information you provided, and is subject to change based on the plan you select, optional benefits you select (if any), and other factors. We shall exclusively determine the premium actually required, and the effective date of any coverage issued. In several states, these plans are available only to members of the Federation of American Consumers and Travelers (FACT), an independent consumer organization. If you are not already a member of FACT, you must join in order to be eligible for these plans. Through a special agreement between FACT and Golden Rule, you can enroll in the association through Golden Rule. You will fill out the FACT enrollment form prior to making application to Golden Rule for health insurance. For more information on the benefits of FACT membership, visit www.usafact.org (no need to enroll directly - Golden Rule will submit your dues to FACT). Estimated Premium does not include the mandatory $4 monthly dues for FACT membership. FACT membership is not required in every state. Please see the product information for details. Note: There are no non-network benefits. You must use a network doctor or hospital. These plans pay no benefits for out-of-network expenses except for emergencies. Emergency treatment from a non-network provider will be treated as a network eligible service. </td>
