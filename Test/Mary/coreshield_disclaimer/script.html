	<td>CORE SHIELD TERMS AND AGREEMENTS FRAUD WARNING*${FW}CORE SHIELD GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS THIS INSURANCE PROVIDES LIMITED BENEFITS. LIMITED BENEFITS PLANS ARE INSURANCE PRODUCTS WITH REDUCED BENEFITS AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO OR INTEGRATED WITH COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. FURTHER, THIS INSURANCE DOES NOT COORDINATE WITH ANY OTHER INSURANCE PLAN. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE MAJOR MEDICAL OR COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL COVERAGE AND IS NOT DESIGNED TO REPLACE MAJOR MEDICAL INSURANCE. THIS INSURANCE IS NOT MINIMUM ESSENTIAL BENEFITS AS SET FORTH UNDER THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. RIGHT TO EXAMINE The Certificate issued to each Insured Person can be returned for any reason within 30 days after it is received by the Insured Person. Any premium paid will be refunded and the Certificate will be treated as if it were never issued. This is a brief summary of Core Shield underwritten by AXIS Insurance Company. Provided by form numbers T-GHI-002-0713-NE, T-GCI-001-0112-NE, and T-GOA-001-0112-NE. Coverage is subject to exclusions and limitations, and may not be available in all US states and jurisdictions. Product availability and plan design features, including eligibility requirements, descriptions of benefits, exclusions or limitations may vary depending on local country or US state laws. Full terms and conditions of coverage, including effective dates of coverage, benefits, limitations, and exclusions, are set forth in the policy. Pre-existing Conditions occurring within the first twelve (12) months of coverage are not payable. ALLIANCE FOR CONSUMER USA ("ACUSA") MEMBER TERMS AND CONDITIONS These Terms and Conditions pertain to the relationship between Alliance For Consumer USA (referred to herein as the "Association" or "ACUSA") and its Members (referred to herein as "Member", "You" or "Your"). Members will receive a Membership Fulfillment Kit with identification cards which will briefly describe the benefits being provided through the Association. Members must remain in good standing with the Association to be eligible for these benefits. The Association is a corporation, having members, formed under the non-profit laws of the State of Nebraska. All members have voting rights in the Association but the Association is managed by a board of directors. As part of the application for membership, every member signed a written proxy that appointed the Secretary of the Association in office at any particular time as your proxy to receive notice of and attend all meetings of the members and vote on your behalf and to otherwise act for you in the same manner and with the same effect as if you were personally present. This proxy shall be valid until revoked at any time prior to voting at any meeting by executing and delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Association, by executing and delivering a subsequently dated proxy to the Secretary of the Association or by voting in person. Nothing herein shall create any employer-employee relationship between the Association and any Member. Failure of a Member to pay their dues will be cause for cancellation of the membership by the Association. The Association reserves the right to suspend or terminate any membership. Returned checks, insufficient fund noticed on bank drafts or denial by the member's credit card company for payment of the periodic amount due is deemed evidence of non-payment by a Member. Any bank service fees charged because such action will be the responsibility of the Member. As authorized at the time of your application, your monthly payment must be paid through an automatic draft of a checking or savings account by an ACH transaction or through an automatic debit transaction to a credit card. By agreeing to make your monthly payment through either ACH transaction or automatic debit transaction to your credit card, you waive the right to any future notice of the transfer of funds via either an ACH transaction or automatic debit to your credit card. The Association retains the services of a third party administrator to perform the collection services or other administrative services required for this membership. As a member you agree that inquiries or challenges to ACH or credit card charges shall be limited to two (2) monthly payment and you waive all rights to inquire into or challenge any and all other monthly payments. Your authority shall remain in effect until the Association receives a signed written required from you to cancel your membership and any plan benefits. If any payment is dishonored (with our without cause, intentionally or inadvertently), the Association assumes no liability whatsoever even if the result of the dishonored payment is a termination of your membership in the Association. Members may change the mode of payment, make a change or cancel their membership at any time upon written notification to the Association. If you choose to cancel your membership, it is your responsibility to make sure that your written request is sent to the Association at least 5 days prior to your next draft date in order for your account not to be charged the membership dues for the following month. Such written notice may be deemed given when delivered by mail to Health Insurance Innovations, 218 E Bearrs Avenue Suite 325, Tampa FL 33613. Dues for membership cancelled within 30 days of the initial effective date shall be refunded in full. Enrollment fees are not refundable unless required by law. Any refund to which a Member may be entitled shall be processed within 10 business days from the date the written request for cancellation is received or 10 days from the date that such funds were received by the Association, whichever is later. Your Association membership may provide access to group or accident or other limited insurance benefits. All group policies providing insured benefits are issued by licensed insurance companies to the Association as the group master insurance policyholder. In the event insurance benefits are provided as part of a benefit package, you are notified that such insurance coverage may terminate on the earlier of the date the group master policy is terminated or on the premium due date on or next following the date a person ceases to be a member or eligible person. A Certificate of Insurance will be provided in membership fulfilment materials. The certificate contains only a brief description or summary of benefits. Any difference between the certificate and the actual insurance policy will be settled according to the specific terms, limitations and exclusions contained in the policy. You may contact Member Services at 877-376-5831 to obtain instructions on how to obtain a claim form from the insurance company. Insurance benefits, if any, are NOT basic health insurance or major medical coverage and are not designed as a substitute or replacement for basic health insurance or major medical coverage. ACUSA DISCLAIMER The Association is not owned or controlled, or affiliated with, any insurance company. The Association is not an insurer, agent, producer, third party administrator, guarantor or underwriter and does not provide any medical treatment, medical services, products, product liability or guarantees for any Member. The Association does not handle, adjust or pay any claims under any insurance policy issued to the Association. </td>
