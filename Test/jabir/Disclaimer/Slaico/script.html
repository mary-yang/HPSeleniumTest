If my medical status changes in this way, coverage will be declined for all individuals included on this Application. I understand that if I have elected the Monthly Payment option, my credit card will be charged each month on the due date of the premium for 6 or 12 months, depending on the plan I have selected. I understand that I may terminate the scheduled payments by notifying Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company or its authorized agent in writing at least one business day prior to the next scheduled payment date. I understand that this coverage is not renewable or extendable. I may obtain a complete copy of the Certificate of Insurance upon request to Health Insurance Innovations. I understand that Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, as underwriter of the plan, is solely liable for the coverage and benefits provided under the insurance. I understand and agree that the insurance agent/broker, if any, assisting with this Application is a representative of the Applicant. If signed by a representative of the Applicant, the undersigned represents his/her capacity to so act. If signed as guardian or proxy of the Applicant, the undersigned represents his/her capacity to so act. By acceptance of coverage and/or submission of any claim for benefits, the Applicant ratifies the authority of the signer to so act and bind the Applicant.</td>

	<td>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I accept and acknowledge that Short-Term health insurance is a temporary plan designed for people who do not currently have health insurance and are waiting for longer term, major medical insurance coverage. Short-term policies do not cover pre-existing conditions. The health insurance plans sold through this Website do not meet the minimum essential coverage under the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act and you may incur a penalty and be assessed a fee with your federal tax return if you only purchase such plans. I accept and acknowledge that I must understand and agree with the terms of the insurance policy, paying attention to the effective date, premium amount, waiting period, benefits, limitations, exclusions, and riders, if applicable in your state. I accept and acknowledge that the quotes or rates shown above are estimates only. My premium is subject to change based on the optional benefits I selected, if any, and other relevant factors, such as changes in rates that take effect before my coverage start date. The insurance company always determines my actual premium. Insurance companies reserve the right to change the terms of a policy upon proper notification. These rates may include monthly administration fees or Membership dues. I accept and acknowledge that the quotes or rates shown above are for my requested effective date ONLY. If the actual effective date of my policy is different from the requested effective date, the actual premium of my policy may differ from the quote or rate above. The change in amount may be due to premium increases or policy changes from the insurance company and/or one or more family members having a birthday. (Rates are highly dependent on age.) The carrier I selected may not guarantee their rates for any period of time. I accept and acknowledge that coverage effective date is dependent upon approval of my application, which may include qualifying for the coverage and receipt of payment, and may be different than my requested date. The coverage effective date once the application is approved by the carrier may be pushed forward due to each carrier's deadlines and processing times. I accept and acknowledge that carriers cannot guarantee the availability of a provider (or providers), and may add, delete or change a participating provider (or providers) at any time without prior notice to me. I must contact my chosen carrier for updated information before using the services of any provider. I accept and acknowledge that each insurance carrier may have unique Notices and Disclaimers. I will check below for information regarding the plans and carriers I selected. I accept and acknowledge that Teladoc & Cigna Dental Network Access are not insurance benefits. These are lifestyle benefits and are not affiliated with any of the insurance companies. Agile Discount Rx Disclaimer: DISCOUNT ONLY. NOT INSURANCE. Discounts are available exclusively through participating pharmacies and providers. The range of the discounts will vary depending on the type of provider and services rendered. This program does not make payments directly to providers. Members are required to pay for all health care services. You may cancel your registration at any time or file a complaint by contacting Customer Care at (800) 314-5594. All prescription drugs are eligible for discount. I have personally completed and reviewed all of my answers to the questions in this enrollment form and represent that all information I have provided is true, complete, and correctly recorded. I understand that this information will be used to determine each person's eligibility and insurability for coverage under the Policy and any false statement or misrepresentation may result in loss of coverage or claim denial. The Applicant (and Spouse or Dependent if coverage elected) must be accepted based on the Company's rules in effect on the date of enrollment and on the Certificate Effective Date. Coverage (or Reinstatement of coverage), if issued and approved by the Company, will become effective on the date recorded in the Certificate Schedule of Benefits and not the date this enrollment form is signed. I understand that no agent or producer can accept risks, modify policies, or waive any rights or requirements of the Company. I accept and acknowledge that I must not cancel any health insurance coverage that I currently have or decline cobra benefits until I receive an approval letter and insurance policy (also known as an insurance contract or certificate) from the insurance company that I have selected. I accept and acknowledge that the Copayment, Deductible, and Coinsurance amounts are my share of the costs for covered benefits. I accept and acknowledge that in several states, these plans are available only to members of an association, an independent consumer organization. If I am not already a member of the association, I must join in order to be eligible for these plans. I accept and acknowledge that if I am not completely satisfied, I can cancel this coverage within the 10-Day Free Look provision, shown in the Certificate of Insurance, for a refund of premiums. I accept and acknowledge that TelaDoc and Cigna Dental Network are optional benefits and are not affiliated with any of the insurance companies. These benefits can be canceled at any time within their 30-Day Free-Look provision for a full refund. I hereby authorize any: physician, medical practitioner, hospital, clinic or other medical related facility, insurance company, insurance support organization, business partner, pharmacy, pharmacy benefit manager, government agency, group policyholder, employer, benefit plan administrator, MIB, Inc., the Department of Motor Vehicle Registration, and paramedical facility to provide to STANDARD LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY, or to any agent, attorney, consumer reporting agency or independent administrator, including medical record retrieval services or pharmaceutical services, acting on STANDARD LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY'S or its reinsurers' behalf, information concerning advice, care or treatment sought by or provided to me and/or any other Proposed Insured for coverage, including information relating to medical history, medical conditions, treatment, hospitalizations or confinements, ailments, and/or drug, alcohol or tobacco usage of the Applicant or any Proposed Insured. It is understood that STANDARD LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY underwriters, claim examiners, reinsurers, attorneys, or the medical director may disclose such health information to the aforementioned parties for purposes of underwriting, compliance, record clarification or explanation, or in response to litigation, summons, or subpoenas. I understand that after this information is disclosed, the recipient may redisclose it, resulting in loss of protection by federal regulations. I understand that: 1. such information will be used by STANDARD LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY for underwriting and insurability determinations; 2. I may refuse to sign this authorization and that my refusal to sign will affect my ability to obtain health insurance coverage; 3. a picture copy or photocopy of this authorization shall be as valid as the original; and 4. I, or my authorized representative, am entitled to receive a copy of this authorization upon request. This authorization is valid from the date signed for a duration of 24 months. I understand I may revoke the authorization at any time, except to the extent that action has been taken in reliance on this authorization, by sending written notice to the Health Underwriting Department of STANDARD LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY, P.O. Box 1991, Galveston, Texas 77553. I may inspect or copy any information used or disclosed under this authorization, if signed.
